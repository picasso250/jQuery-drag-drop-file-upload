This plugin allows you to add drag+drop functionality to any file upload input with support for multiple files. Degrades gracefully for browsers that don't support this functionality.

Usage:
Include the plugin JS and CSS files in your page. Call the following on your page:

$('input[type="file"]').dropUpload({
  'method'       : 'batch',
	'uploadUrl'		 : '/upload',
	'uploaded'		 : function(resp) { },
	'dropClass' 	 : 'file-drop',
	'dropHoverClass' : 'file-drop-hover',
	'defaultText'  	 : 'Drop your files here!',
	'hoverText'		 : 'Let go to upload!'
});

Options:
	method: upload 'batch'-ly or 'one' a time, if it's 'one', uploaded(xhr, index, total)
	uploadUrl: URL where the files should be POST'ed to,
	uploaded: Callback function that is fired when the files have been uploaded,
	dropClass: The default class to apply to the drop area,
	dropHoverClass: The class to apply to the drop area when dragging a file over it,
	defaultText: Default text to show in the drop area,
	hoverText: Text to show in the drop area when dragging a file over it

Let me know if you have any problems!
